# `dir2csv.bat`

## Overview

## How to Use
### 1. Preparation
1. Place the `dir2csv.bat` file in a folder or directory of your choice.
2. Open the script in a text editor (e.g., Notepad) to update the following paths:
   - **`folder`**: The root folder to scan for files.
   - **`output`**: The path where the resulting CSV file will be saved.

### 2. Running the Script
1. Double-click the `dir2csv.bat` file to execute it.
2. The script will process the folder and its subfolders, creating a CSV file at the specified output location.
3. Once completed, the script will display a confirmation message and pause, allowing you to view the output.

## Output Format
The resulting CSV file includes the following columns:
1. **File Name**: Name of the file (with extension).
2. **Last Modified**: Timestamp of when the file was last modified.

Example:
```
File Name,Last Modified
example.txt,2025-01-15 10:23 AM
data.xlsx,2025-01-14 3:45 PM
```

## Customization
- **Change Folder Path**: Modify the `set "folder=..."` line to target a different directory.
- **Change Output File Path**: Update the `set "output=..."` line to specify a new save location for the CSV file.
- **File Extensions**: By default, the script processes all files. To limit this, modify the `for /R` line (e.g., `for /R "%folder%" %%f in (*.txt) do` to include only `.txt` files).

---

## Troubleshooting
- **No Output**: Ensure the folder path and output file path are correct and accessible.
- **Permission Denied**: Run the script with administrative privileges if access is restricted.
- **Wrong Timestamp Format**: The script uses your systemâ€™s date and time format. Check your system settings if the output looks incorrect.
